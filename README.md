- I'm a  **Data scientist** at [The BVA Family](https://www.thebvafamily.com/) in Paris, France ![image](https://github.com/BOUGHANMIChaima/BOUGHANMIChaima/assets/68131205/d3f43111-e7b9-48b2-adeb-b38f2ce73e8b)
. 
- Data science was the perfectly suited discipline for me : 
- I'm an **engineer in statistics and information analysis** from [ESSAI](https://www.essai.rnu.tn/) 
- I held a masterâ€™s degree in **Data Science** from [UniversitÃ© Paris Saclay](https://www.universite-paris-saclay.fr/) 
- and a **research masterâ€™s degree** in information processing and complexity of living systems from [ENIT](https://enit.rnu.tn/). 
- Very comfortable with numbers and statistics, I like to give them meaning and see them have an impact on reality. 
- I have worked in several fields: **energy, sports, polling, FMCG, automotive, telecom, media and marketing**. 
- I have completed my **end-of-studies internship** with [RTE](https://www.rte-france.com/) where I developed an interactive dashboard using **R Shiny** based in statistics and ML for the **energy sector**.
- During my studies, I acquired experience in **mathematical modeling, data analysis, programming, data visualization and machine learning**. 
- I also had the opportunity, through my engineering internship, my two end-of-study internships for masterâ€™s studies and academic projects, to gain an understanding of the data analysis issues in which she was particularly interested, and to build up experience in this field. 
- Through my studies, I developed a deep interest in large-scale **data analysis and processing, forecasting, optimization, data mining and graph theory**. 
- I love bringing numbers to life, giving them meaning and value. 
- I have a very good mastery of programming languages, especially **R and R/shiny**. 
- I was a member of [R-Ladies Tunis](https://www.meetup.com/rladies-tunis/) when I was a student.
- Currently I'm organizer at [R-Ladies Paris](https://www.meetup.com/rladies-paris/). 
- I also masters **Python, SQL, SAS** and, not surprisingly, **Latex and Git**.
- I was awarded the [Posit Conf](https://youtu.be/tD9Vv_wSDdY?feature=shared) scholarship opportunity, the international data science conference, held in Seattle in the USA.
- I presented **R-ladies Paris** at the [useR! 2024 Conference ](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/user/) in Salzburg, **Austria** where I spoke about how to "Leverage R-Ladies Paris Reach for Community Impact" : View the [slides](https://rladiesparis.github.io/rladies_paris_talk_useR2024/rladies_paris_talk_useR2024.html#/title-slide) and the [replay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KqokszC42Uc).
- I am also a **footballer**, so when I'm not playing with numbers and data, I'm playing with the ball ! Thatâ€™s why I chose to work on **tactical analysis of team sports** during my Masterâ€™s research.
- With the **Paris Saclay** football team,  my teammates and I qualified for the 2022 france **championship**, finishing first in Ã®le de France and 5th in all of France.
